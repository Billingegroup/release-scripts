USAGE
=====
Usage: python snake_nest <list_of_python_versions> OPTIONS
For example: python snake_nest "3.10, 3.11, 3.12" OPTIONS
Run using shell: ./snake_nest.py <list_of_python_versions> OPTIONS

DESCRIPTION
===========
This program creates a set of conda environments corresponding to user-inputted python versions. These environments can be used for version-specific testing.
$ python snake_nest "3.10, 3.11, 3.12"
Result: creates three conda environments `py-3.10-env`, `py-3.11-env`, `py-3.12-env`.
The prefix and suffix of the environment names can be specified using `-p` and `-s`: `<prefix><vesion><suffix>`.
You can point to a directory of conda-installable requirements using `-r` and pip-installable requirements using `--pip-requirements`.
Delete these environments using the `--clean` command.
This program can generate a snake nest (directory containing symbolic links to the python executables for each environment) using `--nest`.

OPTIONS
=======
Options (taken from --help):
  -m, --mamba           Use mamba instead of conda. Without this option enabled, conda will be used.

  -p PREFIX, --prefix=PREFIX
                        Set the environment name prefix. Environments will be named <prefix><version><suffix>. The default prefix is "py-".

  -s SUFFIX, --suffix=SUFFIX
                        Set the environment name suffix. Environments will be named <prefix><version><suffix>. The default suffix is "-env".

  --vreqs               Indicate that the requirements to be installed are version-specific. This changes the behavior of the inputs for 
                        --requirements and --pip-requirements. Each now takes in an expression of the form "<prefix>[vsn]<suffix>". The program will
                        replace "[vsn]" with a version number (e.g. 3.10). For example, the input "reqs/py-[vsn]-reqs.txt" corresponds to files like
                        "reqs/py-3.10-reqs.txt".

  -r REQFILE, --requirements=REQFILE
                        A file containing requirements to install in each environment. These requirements must be installable through conda/mamba.

  --pip-requirements=PREQFILE
                        A file containing requirements to install in each environment. These requirements must be installable through pip. It is
                        recommended to install through conda/mamba unless the packages are available only on PyPi.

  -d DEVDIR, --dev-mode=DEVDIR
                        Install the specified directory in developer mode (pip install -e DEVDIR). This command will be run in each environment created.

  --nest=NEST-DIR, --make-snake-nest=NEST-DIR
                        Create a snake nest (a directory containing symbolic links to each version-specific Python executable.) The user should input
                        the path to the desired directory and the program will create that directory if it does not exist. A warning is thrown if there
                        are existing files in the given directory and no snake nest will be generated.

  --clean               Remove version environments. Environments removed are specified the same way as creating environments.

  --run-script          Run a script in each environment. The script file is user-specified. You can include [vsn] in the script and it will be replaced
                        with the proper version number.
